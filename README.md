# robot-tutor

Robot tutor is able to answer questions, convey wisdom and enlighten people. This repository stores my thoughts and implementation of a robot tutor. 

## Implementation Map

### Step 1

Robot tutor can provide books to help solve user-raised questions.

  - Example: User asked how to build and keep up good habits. The robot should be able to recommend books such as Atomic Habits. After each recommendation, the robot gets feedback from the user to update robot's internal model for the user to generate better recommendation next time. 

### Step N
- Observation (To observe a person's action)
- Understanding (To determine a person's state)
- Cause-Effect learning (To forecast effect or deduce cause by learning the model of our world)
- Wisdom learning (To know what is correct)
- Teaching (To enlighten people)
