# robot-tutor

Robot tutor is able to answer questions, convey wisdom and enlighten people. This repository stores my thoughts and implementation of a robot tutor. 

## Implementation Map

- Observation (To observe a person's action)
- Understanding (To determine a person's state)
- Cause-Effect learning (To forecast effect or deduce cause by learning the model of our world)
- Wisdom learning (To know what is correct)
- Teaching (To enlighten people)
