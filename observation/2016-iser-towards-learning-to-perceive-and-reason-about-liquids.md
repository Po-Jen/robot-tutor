# [Towards Learning to Perceive and Reason About Liquids](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~schenckc/iser2016.pdf)

## Objective

Detect and track liquids.

## Proposed solution

Compared three methods: single-frame NN, multi-frame NN and LSTM recurrent NN. And LSTM network outperforms the
other two.

## Evaluation of the proposed solution



## Contribution

## My idea

## My Take-away message

1. If data is hard to acquire, simulation may be a good way to do so
