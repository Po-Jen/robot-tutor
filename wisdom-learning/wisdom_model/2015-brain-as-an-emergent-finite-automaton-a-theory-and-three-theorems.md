# [Brain as an Emergent Finite Automaton: A Theory and Three Theorems](https://file.scirp.org/pdf/IJIS_2015020215342466.pdf)

## Core concept

1. Brain learns invariance of important concepts such as type and location. 
   
   - Type invariance: A toddler learns type invariance when he/she sucks a milk bottle he/she grabbed from different location. 
   - Location invariance: A toddler learns location invariance when he/she grabs different things from the same location. 

2. Brain works as automaton to learn temporal concept such as motion.
